#Repository for "CAPS" Game
This repository contains a C++ 17 program for the game "CAPS." The goal of the game is to move caps to a specified location according to certain rules. Players can only move caps along predetermined paths and cannot move a cap through another cap in its path.

#Implementation Requirements:

Programming Language: C++ 17
Smooth cap movement
Caps can move across multiple connections in one turn if the user-specified path is clear of other caps
Highlighting of available positions for moving the selected cap
Highlighting of the selected cap
Level layout and topology are specified in an external input file
Mouse control for gameplay
Path calculation is done programmatically
Object-oriented approach using header.cpp and header.h for implementation

#Usage Instructions:

Download and compile the C++ 17 program from this repository.
Run the program.
Use the mouse to control the game.
Select a cap to move by clicking on it.
Available positions for moving the selected cap will be highlighted.
Click on one of the highlighted positions to move the selected cap.
Repeat steps 4-6 until you reach the desired cap arrangement and complete the game.

#Repository Structure:

main.cpp: Main program file with the entry point.
caps.cpp, caps.h: Files containing classes and functions for the game and its logic.
header.cpp, header.h: Files containing classes and functions for representing and managing the caps.
input.txt: External input file containing the level's layout and topology.
We hope that this program allows you to enjoy the "CAPS" game and successfully achieve the desired cap arrangement.
